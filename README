This is the source code for the free Android application "Rage Faces".

Enjoy.  Or don't enjoy.  Whatever.

Adding Faces
------------

If you want to add your own faces, they must be:

1. In PNG format.

2. Placed into the /res/raw/ directory.

There are two ways in which Rage Faces finds faces: simple mode, and db mode.
Simple mode is, as it sounds, quite simple; it allows ones to add faces
quickly and easily, but gives you little control over the display order
or filtering.  Db mode uses a database to allow more control over the
faces, in particular adding simplistic category ordering and filtering.

To use simple mode, simply ensure that assets/faces.db is deleted.  The app
will just scan /res/raw/ and grab all PNGs from that directory.

To use db mode, make sure that assets/faces.db exists and link the faces
in /res/raw/ to ids in the db.
